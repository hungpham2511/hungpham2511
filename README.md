### Hi there! I'm Hung 👋

I am a robotic engineer building robots at Eureka Robotics in Singapore. 

In my day-to-day work, I develop algorithms and software for optimal motion planning (allow robots to move efficiently autonomously) and force control (allow robots to *feel* with sensor and behave intelligently). Nowadays, I also enjoy developing multi-view vision systems for high-precision tasks. 

When it is necessary, I also build CI/CD pipeline for testing and deploying robot software.

From time to time, I support my :beer: buddies with [NeuroKit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) -- a Python toolbox for neurophysiological signal processing.
